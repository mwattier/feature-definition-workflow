# TODO

3AM Thoughts on how to improve

- [ ] Add a **2-minute triage step** before template selection
- [ ] Add explicit workflow states and transitions
- [ ] Keep the approved spec frozen. Add a "Implementation Deltas" section at the bottom
- [ ] Add definition debt tracking
- [ ] Create standalone system prompts that can be copy-pasted
- [ ] Add approval checklist to templates
- [ ] Sync with a vector database
- [ ] Chat UI/UX for interested parties to check project progress
