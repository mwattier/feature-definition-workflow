# Feature Definition Examples

Real examples demonstrating the conversational feature definition methodology.

## Available Examples

### 1. User Authentication System

**File**: [example-01-authentication.md](./example-01-authentication.md)

**Type**: Backend feature with security considerations

**Demonstrates**:
- Conversational clarification process
- Data model definition
- Security decision documentation
- Integration with features.json

**Complexity**: Medium
**Use Case**: Production web application

---

### 2. REST API Endpoint

**File**: [example-02-api-endpoint.md](./example-02-api-endpoint.md)

**Type**: API design feature

**Demonstrates**:
- API design decisions
- Error handling specification
- Performance considerations
- Testing criteria

**Complexity**: Small-Medium
**Use Case**: Backend API development

## How to Use These Examples

### Learning the Process

1. **Read the conversation** - See how clarifying questions reveal details
2. **Note the decisions** - Observe how choices are documented
3. **Review the output** - See the final feature document structure
4. **Study the features.json** - Understand tracking integration

### As Templates

- Copy structure for similar feature types
- Adapt questions to your domain
- Modify sections based on needs
- Use as reference during definition

### For Training

- Use as examples when onboarding team members
- Reference when explaining the methodology
- Show before/after to demonstrate value

## Example Structure

Each example includes:

1. **Initial Request** - How the user started
2. **Conversation** - Questions and answers
3. **Feature Document** - The synthesized result
4. **features.json Entry** - Tracking integration
5. **Lessons Learned** - What this example teaches

**Guidelines**:
- Use generic project names ("project-name", not specific projects)
- Remove any proprietary information
- Show the full conversation flow
- Include the resulting feature document
- Document what the example demonstrates
